# Mock-TSAL
Will update soon with ideas and Schematics  ðŸ”¥

<h2>Design constraints:</h2>
- must be controlled directly by the High Voltage, not programmed
- must turn on red light when voltage exceeds 60v
- must be able to handle much higher voltages as well
- when higher than 60v, must be Red Blinking at 2-5 Hz
- when lower than 60v, must be Solid Green
- Must Be illuminated when GLV (grounded Low Voltage) is activated
